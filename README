'Destination' is a tool for helping select the best location to hold a meeting or conference based on the locations of the attendees.

The destination is assumed to be one of the cities that attendees come from.

The calculation identifies the city that involves the minimum total travel time / air miles / carbon footprint.

The fuel and CO2 calculation is approximate and is based on the formula described in http://www.chooseclimate.org/flying/mf.html
